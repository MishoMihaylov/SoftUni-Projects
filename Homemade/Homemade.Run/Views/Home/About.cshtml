        Especially when we’re not living outside the city and growing our food in the backyard.
        We are increasingly looking for real food close to us. Fresh products that we can almost reach out and pick from our garden or take some of grandma’s personal stash.
        The food smells stronger and nicer, the taste is more memorable - it’s a completely different sensation.

        We believe that it’s important to know where our food comes from and who’s producing it. It’s the only way to be certain of its quality.
        We are closely monitoring the quality of the food our partners are producing.
        We have regular check-ups of the ready products as well as the methods it was manufactured or grown by and it’s location.
        We are completely transparent about our practices and we require the same from the producers.

    <b>Food grown with care</b>
    <br /><br />
    <span>
        We believe it’s important that the food our families consume has little to no artificial “improvements”.
        We think food should be tasty and healthy so we can be energetic and happy.
        Because we believe that we can live better and look for the highest quality food.
        Food, grown with attention to every detail, is tastier and healthier.
        We are certain that better food will make the world a better place for each and every one of us - with less hassle and more time for real sensations,
        even if only gustative.
